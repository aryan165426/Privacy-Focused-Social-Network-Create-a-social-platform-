Decentralized Video Sharing Platform
Overview
The Decentralized Video Sharing Platform (DVSP) is an innovative blockchain-based platform that allows users to share videos while retaining full control over their content and revenue. Unlike traditional, centralized video platforms, DVSP utilizes blockchain technology to empower creators by giving them ownership of their content, enabling transparent monetization options, and eliminating intermediaries.

By using decentralized storage systems like IPFS or Arweave and the Aptos blockchain, creators can ensure that their videos remain secure, private, and easily accessible. The platform also provides direct monetization opportunities, such as tips, subscriptions, or advertisements, all handled transparently through smart contracts.

Key Features
Decentralized Storage: Store videos securely on decentralized platforms like IPFS or Arweave, ensuring content ownership and control.
Blockchain Monetization: Directly earn cryptocurrency via tips, subscriptions, and advertisements, without relying on intermediaries.
Transparent Revenue: Track and manage revenue generated from videos in real-time using Aptos blockchain-powered smart contracts.
User Control: Creators can decide who has access to their videos, with granular privacy and access control.
Aptos Blockchain Integration: Fast, scalable, and secure blockchain solution for handling transactions and smart contracts.
Ownership and Security: Decentralization ensures creators retain full control over their content and data.
Tech Stack
Blockchain: Aptos
Smart Contracts: Move (Aptos Smart Contract Language)
Frontend: React.js (or other frontend framework)
Backend: Node.js (for server-side operations)
Storage: IPFS or Arweave (for decentralized file storage)
Authentication: Aptos Wallet (for user authentication and blockchain interactions)
Project Setup
Prerequisites
Node.js: Ensure Node.js (v16.x or higher) is installed. Download Node.js.
Aptos CLI: Install the Aptos CLI to interact with the Aptos blockchain. Aptos CLI Setup.
IPFS or Arweave: Set up decentralized storage via IPFS or Arweave. You can use services like Pinata for IPFS or Arweave for long-term storage.
Installation
Clone the Repository:
bash
Copy
git clone https://github.com/your-username/dvsp.git
cd dvsp
Install Dependencies:
bash
Copy
npm install
Set Up Aptos Wallet:

Create an Aptos Wallet using Aptos Wallet Guide.
Fund your wallet with testnet tokens using the Aptos Faucet.
Deploy Smart Contracts:

Deploy the smart contracts using the Aptos CLI. These contracts handle the upload process, video metadata storage, and revenue sharing.
bash
Copy
aptos move publish --profile <your-profile>
Frontend Configuration:

Set up the contract addresses and network configurations in the frontend to interact with the deployed smart contracts.
Running the Application
To run the application locally:

bash
Copy
npm run dev
This will start the development server at http://localhost:3000.

Frontend Overview
The frontend is built with React.js and interacts with the blockchain via Aptos SDK and smart contracts. You can customize the user interface to fit your branding or add new features by modifying the components under the src folder.

How It Works
1. Uploading Videos
Users can upload videos via the platform’s interface. After uploading, the video content will be stored on a decentralized storage system like IPFS or Arweave. The metadata (e.g., title, description, creator) is stored on the Aptos blockchain, creating an immutable record.

2. Monetizing Content
Creators can set a price for viewing their videos, enable tips, or integrate ads. Smart contracts on the Aptos blockchain handle these monetization features:

Tipping: Viewers can tip creators directly in cryptocurrency.
Subscriptions: Users can subscribe to content creators to view exclusive content.
Advertisements: Creators can choose to include ads, and the smart contract ensures fair revenue distribution.
3. Revenue Tracking
Creators can track their earnings in real-time through the platform, which pulls transaction data from the Aptos blockchain. Revenue from tips, subscriptions, and ads is processed securely and transparently through smart contracts.

4. Content Access Control
Creators can manage who has access to their videos. They can make content public, private, or available only to paying users, ensuring full control over how their videos are shared.

Smart Contract Architecture
The Move smart contracts deployed on the Aptos blockchain handle all key operations, including:

Video Upload: Handles the storage of video metadata on the blockchain.
Monetization: Manages tips, subscription payments, and ad revenue.
Revenue Distribution: Distributes earnings according to preset rules.
Access Control: Ensures only authorized users can view private content.
These contracts ensure secure, transparent, and fair interactions for both creators and viewers.
